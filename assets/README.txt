This is a placeholder for your voice note.

Instructions:
1. Record your voice note (or choose a song).
2. Save it as an MP3 file.
3. Rename the file to `voice-note.mp3`.
4. Place it in this `assets` folder, replacing this text file if necessary (though the app looks for .mp3).

Note: The app will likely fail to play if `voice-note.mp3` does not exist.
For testing, I have updated the code to handle missing audio gracefully, but you should add the file!
